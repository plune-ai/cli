# CLI reference

Plune is a single command, `plune`, with a few subcommands.

```bash
plune --version
plune <command> [options]
```

---

## `plune init`

Creates a `plune.yaml` interactively. It asks a few questions (provider, model, dataset, …) and
writes the file in the current directory.

```bash
plune init
```

- Requires an interactive terminal (TTY). In a non-interactive shell it exits with an error — write
  the `plune.yaml` by hand instead (see [Configuration](./configuration.md)).

---

## `plune run`

Runs the evals defined in your config and reports pass/fail + cost.

```bash
plune run [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--config <path>` | Use a specific config file (default: `plune.yaml` in the current directory). |
| `--only <selector>` | Run a subset. `<selector>` is an eval `id` or `tag:<name>`. **Repeatable**: `--only a --only tag:rag`. |
| `--dry-run` | Estimate cost/tokens without calling the model or touching the cache. Always exits `0`. |
| `--concurrency <n>` | Override how many rows run in parallel (default: the config's `provider.concurrency`, or 4). |
| `--no-cache` | Ignore the cache for this run — always call the model, don't read or write cached completions. |
| `--bail` | Stop after the first eval that fails. |
| `--format <fmt>` | Output format: `console` (default), `json`, or `markdown`. |
| `-o, --output <path>` | Write the report to a file instead of stdout. |

### Examples

```bash
plune run                          # run everything in ./plune.yaml
plune run --config evals/ci.yaml   # a specific config
plune run --only faq-tone          # just one eval, by id
plune run --only tag:smoke         # all evals tagged "smoke"
plune run --dry-run                # how much would a full run cost?
plune run --no-cache --concurrency 8
plune run --bail                   # fail fast
```

### Output

By default Plune prints a **console report**: a summary line, each eval's pass/fail status, and
details for the **failed/errored** rows (passing rows are collapsed). The summary line looks like:

```
12/15 passed · 2 failed · 1 errored · $0.0431
```

Use `--format` to choose the shape and `-o` to write it to a file:

```bash
plune run --format json                    # the raw RunResult, for scripts
plune run --format markdown -o report.md   # a Markdown report (great for PR comments)
```

The full machine-readable result is always written to **`.plune/last-run.json`** (a `RunResult` — see
[How it works](./concepts.md#the-runresult)); `plune report` re-renders it without re-running.

If `--only` matches nothing, Plune prints `No evals matched the selector.` and exits `0`.

### Exit codes

`plune run` sets the process exit code so it slots into CI and shell scripts:

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All assertions passed (or `--dry-run`, or `--only` matched nothing). |
| `1` | At least one assertion **failed** — a quality regression. |
| `2` | A **config/execution error** (bad YAML, missing API key, unknown prompt variable, …), **or** one or more rows **errored** (provider outage) with no normal failures. |

The split between `1` and `2` is deliberate: a model outage (`errored`) is infrastructure, not a
regression in your prompt, so it doesn't masquerade as a `1`. See
[errored vs failed](./concepts.md#errored-vs-failed).

```bash
# In CI:
plune run || code=$?
case $code in
  0) echo "✅ all passed" ;;
  1) echo "❌ quality regression" ; exit 1 ;;
  2) echo "⚠️  infra/config problem" ; exit 1 ;;
esac
```

---

## `plune report`

Re-renders the **most recent run** (from `.plune/last-run.json`) without re-running the evals — handy
for viewing a CI run's result later, or re-formatting it for a PR comment.

```bash
plune report                          # the console report for the last run
plune report --format markdown        # as Markdown
plune report --format json -o run.json
```

### Options

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `console` (default), `json`, or `markdown`. |
| `-o, --output <path>` | Write to a file instead of stdout. |

### Exit codes

| Exit | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Rendered the saved run. |
| `2` | No saved run yet (run `plune run` first), or the saved file is unreadable/malformed. |
